lab3_top: Both partners worked on the file equally, implementing pair programming.
We switched roughly every 15 minutes, having one person typing, and the other instructing.
: 
ModelSim: Pouya was mostly responsible for debugging the synthesizable verilog code once we compiled it in ModelSim.

tb_lab3: Ben was mostly responsible for coding the testbench file.

lab3_wave_rtl.do: Both partners simulated the code in ModelSim

.vo file: Pouya extracted the file from quartus
Ben instructed the  extraction process

95% of the work was done together, with both partners working simultaniousely.
